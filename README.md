# ![Alkahest](Alkahest.ico) Alkahest Unofficial

[![Official version Discord](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/302077598593318912/widget.png)](https://discord.gg/5GTr5mw)

Alkahest is a proxy server for [TERA](http://tera.enmasse.com). At its core,
it's simply a server that relays communication between the game client and
server. Its main usefulness lies in its extensibility; you can write plugins
that can inspect packets, modify them, and send newly constructed packets. This
opens up a lot of possibilities for integrating the game with other software,
as well as adding entirely new features to the game, so long as you can do so
within the framework of the game's network protocol.

This project was started out of a need to have a program similar to
[tera-proxy](https://github.com/meishuu/tera-proxy), but written in a .NET
language so that it could easily use the Windows Presentation Foundation
libraries for the purpose of making a UI overlay for the game. It has since
grown to be a more general-purpose framework for TERA modding, featuring tools
and APIs for accessing data stored with the game client.

## Extended features in unofficial version

* **Plugins system:** Plugins names list, priorities for hooks 
* **Client analysis tools:** DownloadedResources.dat decryption 
* **Security:** Signature change for assembly (optional, similar with ShinraMeter)
* **Core**: Work with partial opcodes, comments/tera-data mess support in opcodes/sysmessages files, opcodes/sysmessages files moved from assembly 
* **Server assembly**: Host file cleanup on error

## Features

* **.NET plugins:** Plugins can be written in any .NET language, including C#,
  F#, Nemerle, etc.
* **Client analysis tools:** Data mining tools allow extraction of opcodes,
  system messages, and data center keys, as well as decryption of the client's
  data center files.
* **Complete region support:** All TERA regions are supported: EU, JP, KR, NA,
  RU, and TW.
* **Fast packet serialization**: Specialized serialization functions are
  automatically generated and compiled at runtime, making packet serialization
  fast and painless.
* **Packet editing:** Packets can easily be intercepted, modified, or even
  constructed from scratch, in either raw or typed form.
* **Packet logging:** Compressed packet logs can be saved for later parsing and
  analysis.
* **Packet parser:** An offline packet parsing tool can generate text dumps of
  packet logs and analyze raw packet structures to find arrays and strings.
* **Python scripting:** One of the default plugins implements Python scripting
  support using IronPython.
* **Reusable core library:** The Alkahest server is only a wrapper around the
  `Alkahest.Core` library which can be embedded in any .NET application.


## Installation

[Installers and archives are available from the releases page.](https://github.com/alexrp/alkahest/releases)

If you want to build Alkahest from source, you will need Visual Studio 2017
(any edition) and .NET Framework 4.6.1. Simply open `Alkahest.sln` and build
it with the `Debug` + `Any CPU` configuration. All build artifacts will end up
in the `Build` directory.

## Configuration

After you've built Alkahest, you will need to configure it. This is done in the
`alkahest-server.exe.config` file. You can find that file in the `Build`
directory if you've built Alkahest from source, or in the directory you
installed Alkahest to.

The most important configuration values you'll need to change are:

* `logLevel`: Most users should set this to `basic`. You can set it higher if
  you don't mind some extra output. Developers should probably leave this at
  `debug`.
* `loggers`: If you don't care much about keeping logs around, remove the
  `file` logger from this list to save disk space.
* `disablePlugins`: Remove any core plugins from this list that you want to
  use. You can also add plugins here that you want to temporarily disable, such
  as the `packet-logger` plugin which is only useful to developers.
* `region`: Set this to `eu`, `jp`, `kr`, `na`, `ru`, or `tw`, or if you're
  playing in EU, `de`, `fr`, or `uk`.

There are many other configuration values that you can play with, but you don't
need to change them if all you want is to use Alkahest for a single TERA client
on your local machine.

If you want to run Alkahest with tera-proxy, see
[this wiki page](https://github.com/alexrp/alkahest/wiki/Interoperability).

## Usage

Once you've configured Alkahest, run `alkahest-server.exe` to start it. Once
Alkahest finishes initializing, and if everything went fine, you should be able
to just start TERA and play.

For some regions, you may need to log into TERA first, then start Alkahest just
before actually launching the game. This is necessary because some regions use
the same host name for logging in and for retrieving the server list, the
latter of which gets redirected by Alkahest. For KR specifically, you need to
start Alkahest right after launching the game, during the splash screen.

Note that, by default, Alkahest will adjust your `hosts` file so that the
host name that the TERA launcher fetches the official server list from will be
redirected to wherever Alkahest is configured to be listening. This is
necessary so that Alkahest can give the client a modified server list where all
IP addresses point to where Alkahest is listening for each server. Modifying
the `hosts` file requires administrative privileges, so you must run Alkahest
as administrator.

## Plugins

The plugin system in Alkahest is what adds actual functionality to the proxy
server. Plugins are installed by dropping them into the `Plugins` directory.

A list of known plugins is maintained on
[this wiki page](https://github.com/alexrp/alkahest/wiki/Known-Plugins). If
you're interested in plugin development, see
[this wiki page](https://github.com/alexrp/alkahest/wiki/Plugin-Development).

## Disclaimer

Technically, using Alkahest could be considered a violation of the terms of
service for all TERA regions. Historically, most publishers have chosen to
tolerate programs such as Shinra Meter, tera-proxy, Alkahest, etc as long as
they're not used for malicious purposes. You'll almost certainly be fine as
long as you don't do anything really stupid. That said, I take absolutely no
responsibility if you do manage to get yourself banned.

Also, Alkahest is meant to enable players to write useful plugins that can
enhance the TERA experience. It is not meant to enable cheating of any sort. It
may or may not be the case that some aspects of TERA's network protocol can be
exploited due to poor design (mainly trusting the client too much). Either way,
I do *not* condone using Alkahest for this, and I *certainly* won't support
such usage. I'd encourage people to report such exploits to the TERA developers
(usually through whichever publisher your server is at).
